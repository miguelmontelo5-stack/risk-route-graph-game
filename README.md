📌 Overview
This repository contains a high-performance pathfinding engine developed in Python that solves complex optimization problems within a directed graph (DiGraph). The system calculates the most efficient route by balancing three variables in real-time: Time, Financial Cost, and Probabilistic Risk.

While presented through a simulation interface, the core logic is designed for high-stakes decision-making environments, such as Algorithmic Trading (MQL5) and B2B Logistics Automation.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Graph Architecture: Utilizes the networkx library to manage a dynamic network of nodes and weighted edges.

Optimization Algorithm: Implements a custom version of Dijkstra’s Algorithm to recalculate "Economic Paths" based on fluctuating risk factors (simulated as weather conditions and regulatory bottlenecks).

State Machine: A robust logic flow handles mission states, financial balance, and event-driven penalties.

Visualization: Developed with pygame to provide a real-time radar-style dashboard for monitoring algorithmic decisions.

📈 Why this matters for MQL5 & Automation
In financial markets, every trade is a path through a "risk graph." This project demonstrates my ability to:

Model complex environments using mathematical structures.

Implement algorithms that prioritize Drawdown Reduction (Risk mitigation) over simple gains.

Build clean, modular Python code that can be used for backtesting and prototyping MQL5 strategies.
